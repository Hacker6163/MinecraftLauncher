Minecraft Launcher by MeGAMEP
=============================

If you want to distribute this free launcher you must do it through this link mega.io/asdadassa I don't know. They allow external links created by the distributor.

If you want to distribute the launcher you must do it from the installer (setup file)

The .jar file is available if you are on a non-windows operating system examples: Ubuntu MacOS Linux and others

Note:
* You can support me by sharing the launcher with everyone.
* You can play safely without breaking the EULA rules:
