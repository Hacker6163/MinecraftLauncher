changes:
- added Database
- added Desing

# Downloads:

- unfortunately I lost the .jar file and the setup :(

# Remenber:
If you're looking at this github, even though it's private,
all I want to say is that this isn't a launcher and you can't play Minecraft, 
it's just a project I created for fun, just add the login system and font.

I just want to tell you this.

I am not responsible for a complaint that they make that I did this project because if

also the project does not have a remote database
