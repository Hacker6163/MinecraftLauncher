# Version Minecraft Launcher 1.0
changes:
- added Database
- added Desing

# Downloads:

- unfortunately I lost the .jar file and the setup :(

# Warning:

- If you are going to download the .jar link, you will automatically download the entire project, including the setup and the .jar, this is only for those who do not have windows, since in the .jar file there are folders with the components of the .jar and without that the .jar does not work and if you download the setup automatically the project is downloaded with its components

# Remenber:
If you're looking at this github, even though it's private,
all I want to say is that this isn't a launcher and you can't play Minecraft, 
it's just a project I created for fun, just add the login system and font.

I just want to tell you this.

I am not responsible for a complaint that they make that I did this project because if

also the project does not have a remote database

# Dependence:

- if you want to have the database to test the project [Donwload Here](https://bit.ly/3J9RWqo "Download Here") the charset is utf8-unicode-ci
