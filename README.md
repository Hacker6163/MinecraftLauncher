# Minecraft Launcher:
- This is a project made just for fun, it's not very complex but I like it, the only thing is to have java and download the database,
  unfortunately before I had a remote database but it had to happen that the database no longer worked.
  I hope they experience as much as they want. if there is any problem in project download like virus detection,
  Let me tell you that it is not and it is worth clarifying that it is made with the Netbeans ide. Thank you.
 
# News:
- I'm going to make the project migrate to Eclipse IDE
  # Minecarft Launcher 5.1:
  changes:
  - Bug fix
  - Now only one instance can be opened

  - Details added to the executable

  - The old updates and download links are no longer here, [Click Here](https://bit.ly/3XJfnP1 "Click Here") to see the old news and download links

# Remenber:
- If you're looking at this github, even though it's private,
all I want to say is that this isn't a launcher and you can't play Minecraft, 
it's just a project I created for fun, just add the login system and font.

- If you are going to download the .jar link, you will automatically download the entire project, including the setup and the .jar, this is only for those who do not have windows, since in the .jar file there are folders with the components of the .jar and without that the .jar does not work and if you download the setup automatically the project is downloaded with its components

- If you are using a non-windows operating system, you will need to install the .zip or .targ file

# Dependence:

- if you want to have the database to test the project [Download Here](https://bit.ly/41RMVMP "Download Here") the charset is utf8-unicode-ci
